            <p> <strong> We are happy to announce our first Animal Ambulance in Thane.

                We at Citizens For Animal Protection (CAP) Foundation would like to express our deepest gratitude to team PAWS & Nilesh Bhanage for gifting us their old ambulance.
                
                We receive on average 20-30 distress calls throughout the day, it'll surely help us in increasing our response time and reducing the mortality rate of animals in distress.
                
                The ambulance service will be functional 11 hours a day for 6 days a week with an experienced driver and trained member of our rescue team.
                
                We'll be charging a nominal fee to keep it functional and support our shelter Freedom Farm
