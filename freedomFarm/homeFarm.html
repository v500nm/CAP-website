        </div>
        <br>
        <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">About the organization </h4>
        <p> Citizens for Animal Protection Foundation is a Registered NGO (Registration Number – MAH/319/2020) based in Thane, Mumbai, Maharashtra. </p>
        <p> Our aim is to work towards expanding the circle of compassion towards animals. We believe that everyone has a right to live in harmony, peace and be treated with compassion. </p>
        <br>
        <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Work </h4>
        <p>We work towards various avenues of animal welfare and try to reach to as many animals as possible. Here is a brief about each of them; </p>
        <br>
        <h4>1. Rescue and Rehabilitation</h4>
        <p>As an animal welfare organization, we attend various calls of injured and abandoned animals across the city on an everyday basis. Depending on the situation and severity of the case, we either get the ones who are injured treated or guide the
            caretaker of the animal on how to take care. After an assessment on their quality of life, we rehabilitate them by either releasing them back in their natural habitat or by finding a permanent home for them through adoption. </p>
        <br>
        <h4>2. Relief Work </h4>
        <p>Whenever there is a case of a natural calamity like floods or even a situation like recent pandemic, we work towards helping the animals in the affected areas with food and/or medication along with the NDRF Team and local authorities. </p>
        <br>
        <h4>3. Animal Cruelty</h4>
        <p>As an organization, we work towards empowering and assisting people to report any animal cruelty cases they come across.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>4. Animal Shelter</h4>
        <p>In association with Yeour Environmental Society, we are building Thane's first animal shelter which would cater to all kinds of animals in need. It will also be an educational centre to raise awareness and give practical knowledge about all kinds
            of animals. </p>
        <br>
        <h4>5. Animal Rights & Advocacy </h4>
        <p>There are laws present in our country, as far as animal welfare is concerned. However, there is no implementation of the same. We as an organization work towards pushing the authorities in the implementation of these laws and help in animal friendly
            policies. </p>
        <br>
        <h4>6. Animal Welfare Awareness </h4>
        <p>Our work is to empower more people to start helping animals. For this, we educate people on various aspects of Animal Welfare for an animal friendly society.</p>

            <h3>Work Done So Far </h3>
            <br>
            <p>● In the year 2020, we were able to attend 650 rescue cases on injured and/or abandoned animals, get 27 successful adoptions done, organise 5 successful campaigns, handle 7 cruelty cases and conduct 7 awareness sessions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>● Hungry Hai Sabhi – an initiative during last year’s lockdown. Here, we identify animals which require food across the city and provide them food with the help of RAWW Foundation and local volunteers, we delivered food in the respective areas.
                We were able to provide food for 5589 animals across 80+ locations with daily food in Maharashtra.</p>
